# Introduction


Yuno is a context based search engine that indexes over 0.5 million anime reviews and other anime informations. To help you find anime with specific properties. This search engine will help people of [r/AnimeSuggest](http://reddit.com/r/AnimeSuggest) who are looking for specific type of anime to watch.

This search engine was created to solve the problem of finding an object with specific properties and the object in this case is anime. But this search engine can be easily extended to any domain like books,movies,etc. Without the need of any kind of handcrafted dataset.
