Yuno is a context based search engine that indexes over 0.5 million anime reviews and other anime informations. To help you find anime with specific properties. This search engine will help people of [r/AnimeSuggest](http://reddit.com/r/AnimeSuggest) who are looking for specific type of anime to watch.
